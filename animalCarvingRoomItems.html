<h5>Chest of Charisma </h5>
<p>Talking</p>	
	<ul>
		<li>3,000gp</li>
		<li>Jacinth Of Inestimable Beauty (and a note)</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Legend tells of an exquisite jacinth that was
				found by one of the first dwarven miners, far in the
				north of Faerûn. The uncut gem was of such
				singular beauty that it tempted an elf who was
				visiting the dwarf clan. That elf, Silverleaf, slew the
				dwarf who found the Jacinth and fled to the high
				courts of Aryvandaar with it. According to legend,
				this was the beginning of the antipathy between
				elves and dwarves.</li>
			<li>Silverleaf fashioned the facets of the orange jewel
				into the shape of a flower and mounted it on a
				brooch of gold. Then he bathed the Jacinth in the
				high elven magic of Aryvandaar’s mythal to
				enhance the beauty and durability of the gem.
				Unbeknownst to him, there was hidden power in
				the Jacinth which the mythal’s magic caused to
				blossom.</li>
			<li>When the full powers of the Jacinth became
				known, Silverleaf gave it in tribute to the Coronal of
				Aryvandaar. It remained in the treasure vaults of
				Aryvandaar for many centuries but was lost during
				the Third Crown War. No one knows where it went
				next, though rumor suggests it passed through the
				hands of the Sage of Caster Hills at least once and
				for a time it was a cherished relic of the High Priest
				of Ubtao in darkest Chult.</li>
			<li>You must be of good alignment to attune to the
				Jacinth. If you are neutral or evil, the Jacinth strikes
				you down; you must succeed on a DC 20
				Constitution saving throw or instantly die. On a
				success, you take 24d6 points of radiant damage
				(which ignores resistance and immunity), and your
				alignment immediately changes to neutral good.</li>
			<li>The benefits granted by the Jacinth last only as
				long as you strive to do good. If you fail to perform
				at least one act of kindness or generosity every 10
				days, or if you willingly perform an evil act, the
				Jacinth disappears, and you lose all the benefits
				granted by it.</li>
			<li>Advanted on all Charisma saving throws and skill checks</li>
			<li>+2 to Charisma (not mod) permanently, raises limit to 22</li>

		</ul>
		<li> Drum's of Marching </li>
		<ul>
			<li>Wooden drums with leather. Runes are etched in the side.</li>
			<li>When playing, make a DC 15 Charisma(Perform) Check. If success, everyone in earshot (120ft) gains
			advantage during their next turn in battle or on 1 saving throw
			</li>
			<li>The leather is incredibly worn, so the drum can only be played 2x a day before it needs to be oiled.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Leather Conditioner</li>
		<li>Potion of Eagle's Splendor</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Advantage on Charisma Checks for 1 hour</li>
